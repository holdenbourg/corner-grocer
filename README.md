1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - This project hepled to take in a file containing a grocery stores item purchase data and display this data in multiple different ways depending on how the user wanted to view it.
2. What did you do particularly well?
  - I believe I designed my code very well in that it is efficient and straight to the point without wasting time or space.
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  - I believe I could've utilized a HashMap (unordered_map) in my option one function to just print the key (grocery item) and the value (item purchase frequency) by looking the key up instead of looping through the whole list and using a counter variable.
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - As I mainly program in Java and TypeScript I found it challenging to utilize a HashMap as the syntax differs but after using StackOverflow to help with the #include and implementation syntax it was smooth sailing.
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  - A skill I'll utilize forever on after this project wiuld be the power of HashMap's and there aide in almost any situation involving data as they help reduce time by sacrificing a little space which a lot of developers would see as a good trade off.
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - I made it maintainable by describing each method with corresponding comments to help me understand what functions are suppose to do which'll make it easier to debug in the future if I notoce a method not doing what it's suppose to.
    The comments also help with readability as the help other users explain what's happening, how it's happening and why it's happening. It is adaptable as I could add as many option function I please to visualize the data in different ways.
